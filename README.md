# optimal-basket-split


This project provides an algorithm and Python implementation for maximizing discounts when purchasing products under a discount system commonly used in consumer electronics stores in Poland.
It finds the best way to split a list of product prices into baskets, so that the total discount is as large as possible.

## Features

- Reads product prices from a text file (one price per line, supports decimals).
- Applies basket-based discount rules:
  - 2 products: 30% off the cheapest
  - 3 products: 55% off the cheapest
  - 4 products: 80% off the cheapest
  - 5 products: cheapest for 1 PLN
- Finds the optimal split of products into baskets to maximize total discount.
- Prints detailed basket summaries and overall totals.

## Usage

1. **Prepare your input file**  
   Create a file named `list_of_products.txt` in the project directory, with each product price on a separate line, e.g.:
   ```
   100.00
   200.50
   300.99
   400.00
   ```

2. **Run the program**
   ```bash
   python3 optimal_basket_split.py
   ```

3. **View the output**
   The program will print basket breakdowns and a summary of total prices and discounts.

## Example Output

```
Basket 1: ['100.00', '200.50']
  Total before discount: 300.50 PLN
  Total after discount:  270.50 PLN
  Discount:              30.00 PLN

Basket 2: ['300.99', '400.00']
  Total before discount: 700.99 PLN
  Total after discount:  610.69 PLN
  Discount:              90.30 PLN

Summary:
  Total before discount: 1001.49 PLN
  Total after discount:  881.19 PLN
  Total discount:        120.30 PLN
```

## How it works

The algorithm uses recursion and memoization to efficiently explore all possible ways to split the products into baskets of 2â€“5 items, applying the discount rules to each basket.  
It selects the split that yields the highest total discount.
